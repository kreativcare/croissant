    <p>
      A croissant is a buttery, flaky, viennoiserie pastry of Austrian origin,
      named for its historical crescent shape. Croissants and other viennoiserie
      are made of a layered yeast-leavened dough

    <h2>The different variants of Croissants</h2>
    <p>
      Uncooked croissant dough can also be wrapped around any praline, almond
      paste, or chocolate before it is baked (in the last case, it becomes like
      pain au chocolat, which has a different, non-crescent, shape), or sliced
      to include sweet or savoury fillings. It may be flavored with dried fruit
      such as sultanas or raisins, or other fruits such as apples. In France and
      Spain, croissants are generally sold without filling and eaten without
      added butter, but sometimes with almond filling. In the United States,
      sweet fillings or toppings are sometimes used, and warm croissants may be
      filled with ham and cheese, or feta cheese and spinach. In the Levant,
      croissants are sold plain or filled with chocolate, cheese, almonds, or
      zaatar. In Germany, croissants are sometimes filled with Nutella or
      persipan; in southern Germany, there is also a popular variety of a
      croissant glazed with lye (Laugencroissant). In the German-speaking part
      of Switzerland, the croissant is typically called a Gipfeli; this usually
      has a crisper crust and is less buttery than the French-style croissant.
